A Simulation Framework to Analyze Knowledge Exchange Strategies in Distributed Self-Adaptive Systems

SAKE is a simulation framework to analyze knowledge exchange strategies in distributed self-adaptive system. Therefor the concept of an agent as seen in figure 1 is easily extendable by new functionality which could be new behaviors, goals, roles, hardware-components and knowledge merge algorithms.

To measure the quality properties of a simulation run we distinguish between this quality properties:

- <b>Performance</b> The performance of the system will decrease if there is unnecessary knowledge exchange. This means more network communication and more computational work for the system.

- <b>Real-Time</b> Systems can have time restrictions (deadlines), which are not to be missed, in an environment.

- <b>Energy Consumption</b> The more knowledge is to be exchanged, the more energy is spent for it, but the capacity of the participating subsystems is often restricted.

- <b>Memory Consumption</b> Small devices are often limited in terms of their memory. Thus, gathering all available knowledge on a single device can be impossible.

- <b>Privacy</b> If the system comprises devices from different owners, policies to prevent unauthorized knowledge exchange are required.

Have fun to test it and extend it with new functionality.
